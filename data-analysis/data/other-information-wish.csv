229,Ai needs provide more sources of information and news found. backing up the facts to form a more believable story!

76,"More information about the source, date of creation of website/newspaper, author, author history previous articles written"
215,How the facts are being cherry picked.  Simply saying facts in the article are correct does not guarantee complete context 
338,Search engine results of the article title so I can view all the sources that the AI is using to draw its information from.

387,"All available  details, from sources to possible narratives being pushed and the reasons why a certain narrative may be favored."
351,"To better assess the truthfulness of an article, it is helpful to gather additional information from reliable and diverse sources"
199,I felt as if the AI used the same formula for every article and if the controversy was popular then he automatically went for it. 
211,The actual name or identity of a source rather than it just being indicated whether or not it's a trusted or untrustworthy source 
190,"I particularly liked the info about the source, but I found that the text passages the AI selected were not always relevant to rating"
367,"If there are other sources online that have also analyzed the article against real or fake news, and if so, what were their findings? "
230,The actual source it came from so I can run that source through a media bias chart to get a better idea of its neutrality and reliability.
337,"Knowing the date published and writer of the article, as well as the sources used, would help me better assess the truthfulness of an article."
31,I don't think it is possible but I would like to see a highlighted area within the article that provided the AI with the push one way or the other. 
348,"There are a lot of different aspect of the articles it seemed the AI didn't even address, which were actually why I gave the truthfulness scores I did. "
50,"The place in which it was published, like what magazine or what newspaper or what website it was published on, not the source, but the actual publication."
62,"No additional information is needed in my opinion I was able to find my information elsewhere when needed to confirm the ""AI's"" assumption on the article "
46,"One article didn't have any information on the headline claim, such as ""X organization's policy is"", but then the written material was an ideological opinion."
203,Links to similar news articles so I could either gather more information or do my own research to decide whether or not I believe the news to be fake or true.
117,Providing multiple sources for the article would further verify the integrity of the article. Some sort of fact-checking information would also be a good addition.
237,"Author name and credentials. Also, an article can have heavy emotional wording but still be 100% true. From what I’ve seen, the AI doesn’t take that into consideration. "
394,"Actual facts that did happen, without it assuming the things that happened either happened or not because of something else without actually have concrete information about it."
104,Allow the AI System to identify the references mentioned and where they can be found to verify the credibility or non-credibility rating that it was used to determine the rating.
97,"What is the algorithm? What information does it find truthful? Dates, peoples names? Could it tell me if this is an opinion or editorial article? Is it from a random blog or a newspaper?"
371,I would like more on the truth or falsity of the articles' factual assertions. Several of the articles made factual assertions that were plainly false. The AI sometimes did not catch these. 
355,"It would be great if information was provided regarding the factors used in the truthfulness assessment, because I feel like it did not match with the natural language explanation all the time.  "
329,I would like to see more information for both sides of true and false. A lot of the AI explanations had either why the article was true or false and did not explain both the true and the false sides to the articles.
4,Who the source actually is and why they have been classified the way they have been.  I don't believe the reliability of the source because that can also be programmed into the AI based on the parameters set by the coders
358,"To evaluate the veracity of an article, other relevant information includes the source of the article, the date of publication, the presence of reliable references and citations, the author´s reputation and consistency with other trustwortly sources."
185,"More information on how AI arrives at its conclusion about the quality of the source. It states whether the source is good or bad, but doesn't tell us why, exactly. Is it a tabloid? An opinion blog? News commentary? Some of that info might be helpful. "
158,"I think assessing whether information is true rather than whether it could be true is the most important classification. I'd rather that the AI actually search the web to find if the information was true rather than rate it based on how ""emotional"" it was."
378,Callout for citations or lack thereof; distance from a primary source.  Some articles need additional fact checking or supporting figures.  Automated perusal of references an citation would be helpful if possible.  Links to reviews or responses would be useful.
261,"There are social psychologists who have compiled data about techniques of ""social influence"" and ""persuasion"". It would be extremely helpful to have the ai identify those techniques and to point them out. (loaded language is one of them, which this ai is already using)."
8,"One of the most important things in determining the truth of an article is looking at the emotional words being used. I think that the AI should track the emotional words that are not used within quotes, to further determine if the article is a thought piece, or a legitimate news article. "
159,"I might prefer a line by line/claim by claim assessment and rating rather than selecting limited text to base an overall truthfulness rating on. I felt like the text that was evaluated in some of the samples was not refelcting the most salient points and claims in the article that I might have chosen to ""fact check"" instead of what the AI chose."
