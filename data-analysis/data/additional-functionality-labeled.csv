371,"Links to articles that either help corroborate, clarify, or dispute the article in question. Or a notification that such links do not exist; in other words, the so-called news reported in the article in question is not mentioned elsewhere. That is a big red flag. ",0,0

Example: Not just text or slider but pictures or source searches/links. Hope this helps! Thanks for the bonus and the opportunity! ",0,1
117,"A contextual understanding would allow the AI-system to further determine whether the information presented is relevant and up-to-date. In addition, something this AI-system clearly lacks is the ability to cross-reference multiple sources to verify the integrity of the articles. Having multiple sources would further enhance the capabilities of the AI-system.",0,0
131,"Under the assumption that the AI-System was given a database of sorts as reference, I believe a good addition would be a filter of sorts that scans for certain keywords that may be used in false, biased articles to slander or undermine the opposition of their stance. Doing so may overall help to reduce the number of times the AI-System innaccurately labels an article as ""truthful"".",0,1

This ai picks up emotion-inducing words, but the ai specifically identifying fear and anger-inducing words and phrases, in addition to what this ai already picks up would be extremely helpful. Including a fact-checking capability would be great too.",0,1
98,"The reasoning behind it's decision of the ""Truthfulness"", as it may be made from either it being unable to sift through the common named article, or similar items but different topic all together. I believe it could become confused if this is the case. As it was with the global boyhood initiative. If you google it, the first thing that pops up is Gilette products sight. But directly underneath it was the similarly named article, that was in fact, true.",0,1
