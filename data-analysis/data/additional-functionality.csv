233,I'm not entirely sure what else I would add to improve functionality and or efficiency at this time.
223,I think the evaluation of the author of an article itself should be a good functionality to be added.
269,The ability to highlight specific text in an article to have the AI-System analyze a sentence or phrase.
109,I think a good addition would be to add the ability for the AI-System to explain why it chose its score.
161,A good addition would be to have a system to show how the AI got the specific number on the meter rating

358,The transparency of your data sources and the ability to correct errors or provide justification for your responses.
238,I found the system to be overall quite helpful with the only addition being more information about the news sources.
150,This AI needs to list the source for each article and explain why the source is marked trustworthy or untrustworthy.
319,View a link to the original article as well as sources of how the AI is classifying the information as true of fake.
251,Taking into account how truthful a source has been in the past to determine truthfulness of the article being analyzed
155,"Maybe cross referencing between sources, or an overall truthfulness rating on a source based on their overall articles"
232,"offering related articles from multiple sources, citation checker, and rating the reliability of the source site/ author"
69,Being able to detect which part of the article was most truthful and which part of the article was determined to be fake. 
81,Having links to the original source and links to other related articles that help check the truthfulness of the news article.
136,"Name the specific sources that the AI has deemed trustworthy or untrustworthy, in addition to the information already provided."
229,"dates, times , news/ article based off facts given. let the reader know that article was created using Ai based off  certain facts"
149,Being able to see how many similar stories by other sources are being done on the same topic as a way to fact check the information.
120,"A clear explanation on which the AI system bases its rating, as it varies regularly. (e.g.: high rating for an untrustworthy source)"
191,A system where other users that have used the same article with the AI can comment on how accurate they feel this information is given.
185,"Like I stated above, more information about the source. Perhaps who owns it, if it has affliate agencies, what genre of news is it, etc? "
388,The list or resources at the end of the passage or underlining the information is not relevant when showing how the AI rated the article.
329,A good addition for functionality would be to help find additional sources that would either support or tear down an articles truthfulness.
230,Additional sources to confirm or deny the AI's claim on truthfulness. Blindly trusting things is not something I am super comfortable with.
195,"I'm not sure if this can be done yet, but if the AI can generate/pull information from outside sources to prove the articles truthfullness. "
347,"A feature that scores sources on their reputation, suggested articles that support or collaberate the information of the article in question."
106,"Comparing the information/statistics to other news sources, grammar/spelling checks, formality of language, type of source (blog, website, etc.)"
94,"The functionality of knowing where the user is searching from could be used for relevant information, as well as the information it gives currently. "
100,"Perhaps if readers could also give their ratings in a separate score for others to consider, this could be helpful. I understand this can be abused. "
124,"As a final step prior to recalibrating how ""truthful"" a reader finds the article to be, another AI based rating on a similar article from said source."
427,ability to generate a new natural language explanation if you don't understand the first one that well. Not all of them were super easy to understand.
408,"Ability to query the AI. I would like to know why some of the truthfulness assessments didn't match the explanations, it seemed to be a glitch in the AI."
378,"Links to information referenced in the explanation text; links to articles covering the same or related material, especially those rated higher by the AI"
381,"I'm not sure I'd add another function, between the numerical rating, date, source, and explanation I think it covers a variety of ways to convey its findings"
174,A comparison to other available news sources about the subject as well as independent sources like for example government sources or something of that nature
237,Author name and credentials that possibly go into a system and receive their own rating based on previous number of articles that have been truthful/verified. 
104,Expanding the explanation area from the AI of why and to verify or list sources used to determine the rating it provided.. based on what information? Thank you.
267,The AI system is new and will be tested over a period of time and will improve over time and soon they will able to feel and think that addition will change the world.
159,"Line by line/claim by claim evaluations and ratings, and something to tell me why the AI agrees or disagrees with the evaluated text, and why the source is considered untrustworthy."
236,"A human double checking the AI's results. I think having AI solely making decisions about fake news using the criteria here is not enough, but it is a good starting point and reference for a human. "
154,"The addition of the source itself. The A.I. could possibly be programmed to judge the truthfulness of an article based on the ""truthfulness average"" of all articles it has seen from that one source."
63,Ability to see what criteria the AI-System used to create it's judgement for specific articles. The option to mark the headline's truthfulness or relevance separately from the contents of the article.
249,Broaden text passages used to access truthfulness. One sentence does not give an accurate picture of an entire article. So while that one sentence may be true what the article itself goes on to say about that cannot be accessed properly.
294,"Grammar and punctuation error detection. Reputable news sources have rare errors, but unreliable ones tend to have poor writing skills. It's not an absolutely guarantee of accuracy, but the ""fake news"" articles generally aren't well written. "
28,"More information on the article & author, some are hard to judge simply on the face of them. The story about the outside air conditioners for instance, I wouldn't have thought that was a real thing since air conditioners produce as much heat as they do cooling."
371,"Links to articles that either help corroborate, clarify, or dispute the article in question. Or a notification that such links do not exist; in other words, the so-called news reported in the article in question is not mentioned elsewhere. That is a big red flag. "
62,More suggesting reasons as to why or why not the information provided was true or not. Site sources etc... Bing - AI is great at this. Multiple response types would be good too. Example: Not just text or slider but pictures or source searches/links. Hope this helps! Thanks for the bonus and the opportunity! 
117,"A contextual understanding would allow the AI-system to further determine whether the information presented is relevant and up-to-date. In addition, something this AI-system clearly lacks is the ability to cross-reference multiple sources to verify the integrity of the articles. Having multiple sources would further enhance the capabilities of the AI-system."
131,"Under the assumption that the AI-System was given a database of sorts as reference, I believe a good addition would be a filter of sorts that scans for certain keywords that may be used in false, biased articles to slander or undermine the opposition of their stance. Doing so may overall help to reduce the number of times the AI-System innaccurately labels an article as ""truthful""."
261,"Identification of common methods of social persuasion and undue influence, identification of things like scapegoating, dehumanizing language, words and phrases meant to induce fear and anger. This ai picks up emotion-inducing words, but the ai specifically identifying fear and anger-inducing words and phrases, in addition to what this ai already picks up would be extremely helpful. Including a fact-checking capability would be great too."
98,"The reasoning behind it's decision of the ""Truthfulness"", as it may be made from either it being unable to sift through the common named article, or similar items but different topic all together. I believe it could become confused if this is the case. As it was with the global boyhood initiative. If you google it, the first thing that pops up is Gilette products sight. But directly underneath it was the similarly named article, that was in fact, true."
