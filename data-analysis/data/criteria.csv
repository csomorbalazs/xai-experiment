364,I rely heavily upon grammar and style of an article upon initially glancing at an article.  source is very important when deciding what to believe.
225,"I evaluate who published the article. A blog, news source, or popular scientific journal all have varying degrees of authority and trustworthiness."
355,I typically review the source of the article and assess if the language used in the article is more informative or tends toward eliciting a reaction. 
117,"Some criteria would be accuracy, credibility of the source, objectivity/tone of the article, relevance, timeliness, and the reputation of the publisher. "
350,"I prefer articles that give facts and allow me to form my own opinions. Articles that tell me how I should feel about a subject, I generally rate as not truthful."

184,"The name of the publication and its overall reputation as well as whether the article is well-written(no grammar mistakes, which were present in a couple of the articles)."
236,Does the article make logical sense? What kind of emotional language is used? What source am I getting the news/article from? Which friend shared or liked the news/article?
180,"Source, author position and relation to the subject matter, and if the article is neutral and not trying to sway the reader to choose a political view to the left or right."
200,"Source, publishing date (depends on my research topic), language used by journalist (Less like a gossip page, cites sources and quotes, more like an interview or research paper"
100,I use the date and source reliability to judge if an article is reliable. I also notice how many other reputable sources report the same information and what their sources are.
98,"The way it will describe ""victims"", or any politician. If it is vague, or seems very absurd, it is very easy to take the hint to just go look it up and double check on other articles/sources"
294,"The source of the article (i.e. publisher), the neutrality of the language, the number of grammar/punctuation errors, the persons/institutions interviewed, the controversy level of the topic"
106,"I decide based on where the article is from (based on reputation and personal experience), whether or not I can find other reputable sources will similar claims, grammar checks, and writing style."
300,"Supporting/contradicting data from a different, uncited source. The reputation of the originating and supporting/cited source(s). Multiple supporting/contradicting reports with the same or similar data."
408,"Within this test, I relied on my knowledge of current events. All the fake news examples were easy to spot because they obviously inserted political agendas into what should have been neutral reporting. "
230,If upon first glance it feels skewed or neutral to me. Then testing the source on a media bias chart. Then seeing if there are other articles that support or contradict the claims in the original article.
358,"The criteria I Usually use to judge the reliability of a news or article are: trustworthy source, evidence-based, impartiality, consistency with other reliable sources and transparency in presenting the facts."
381,"Extreme or inflammatory language and phrasing, if an article is simply presenting facts or stating opinions, if an article is trying to rile up the readers' emotions to achieve an emotional response rather than a logical one"
388,The first thing I look is the source of the article and then I go ahead and compare it to video (if available) shown in the news or Youtube. I also check who the writer/journalist was and the tone in which the article was written. 
290,"Whether the source is well known, and if so trusted. If it is a site I am not familiar with, I check for identifying features like a phone numbers, address, or About section. I also use various websites that check the validity of the site."
329,the main criteria I tend to use are looking at the source(s) for an article and using my knowledge of the world around me. I also look for bold statements that are meant to cause controversy or is the article using statements that sound neutral and informative. 
159,"Poor grammar, odd capitalization choices, all-caps wrds within the headline, etc. are all red flags to the quality of ""journalism"" being offered. If the article alse seems to clearly favor one side of viewpoint over the other, I don't assume it's fake news, but I assume it's incomplete news."
261,"Most important is the source of information, as well as which journalist has investigated and reported. Then identifying loaded language. I also keep abreast of current debunked conspiracy theories. I'm familiar with the techniques of social influence and persuasion as well as joseph Goebbels' Principles of Propaganda."
378,"On first glance, style, especially the presence of inflammatory statements or hyperbole; also presence of an author's name and publication date.  Second, reputation of the source or publisher.  Third and possible most importantly, use of cited figures with a reference list at the end.  Fourth, some indication of understanding and interpretation of referenced information."
371,"If I know something about the subject, if an obvious point is disregarded or made light of, then I get suspicious. Second, if an article does not quote from both liberals and conservatives, I feel an agenda is being pushed. Lastly, I fact check an article's assertions  with a Google search. This last method is the best way to assess an article's good faith/truthfulness.  "
